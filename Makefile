#
# This is an example Makefile for a countwords program.  This
# program uses both the scanner module and a counter module.
# Typing 'make' or 'make count' will create the executable file.
#

# define some Makefile variables for the compiler and compiler flags
# to use Makefile variables later in the Makefile: $()
#
#  -g    adds debugging information to the executable file
#  -Wall turns on most, but not all, compiler warnings
#
# for C++ define  CC = g++
CC = g++
LIBSERVER = -levent

# typing 'make' will invoke the first target entry in the file 
# (in this case the default target entry)
# you can name this target entry anything, but "default" or "all"
# are the most commonly used names by convention
#
default: server

# To create the executable file count we need the following object files
server:  server.o
	$(CC) -o server server.o $(LIBSERVER)

server.o: server.cpp 
	$(CC) -c server.cpp $(LIBSERVER)

# To start over from scratch, type 'make clean'.  This
# removes the executable file, as well as old .o object
# files and *~ backup files:
#
clean: 
	$(RM) count *.o *~
